## Overview of the Problem
How Might We... connect the right talent (leaders) to the positions identified in the Tech Talent For 21st Century Government manual?

Problem: There are positions in these government organizations that need filling and we are trying to find ways to adequately match potential candidates to specified positions. 

## KEY SEED QUESTIONS

How might we help tech talent to better understand the job positions in government organizations?
How might we connect the right talent to the positions identified in the Tech Talent for 21st Century Government manual?
How might we help governments find the right tech talent with the ideal skill sets?
How might we improve the interaction mechanisms between tech talents and the government organizations?
How might we help the tech talents to know whether the job positions in government are suitable for them or not?
How might we reduce the existing gap between government and tech talent?

## IDEAS AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS

Our group focused on applying the updated technology to build digital platforms for tech talent and government organizations, which can promote effective communications and start to build stable relationships.  We think the federal government must increase its capacity to deliver services digitally to the public, helping people to understand the mission and strategy of the federal government in a more efficient way. Our group come up with three approaches to achieve our goals and deal with the existing problems

## Position Description
The digital platform can list the job positions of the federal government, such as administrative legal, technology officers, and information technology officers.
The digital platform can use machine learning and data science to predict the potential suitable positions for the tech talent
The platform can have artificial intelligence which can match the positions and tech talents automatically based on the specific skills required for the job

## Skill Sets Introduction
The digital platform can connect other job-finding social media platforms broadly, such as Linkedin and Handshake. Therefore, the government related platform can join in the ecosystems of social job market, helping government to know the tech talents better
There exists a filtering mechanism in the digital platform which helps both government and tech talent to find the right target (position and person). The matching process is based on the skill sets required by government and skill sets owned by tech talent
The digital platform may use icon and other artistic design to present the skill sets visually, making people to understand the skill sets directly and quickly

##Relationship Establishment
The digital platform can not only provide an opportunity for the federal government and tech talent to know each other better, but also can motivate tech talent to join the ideal positions in government organizations. (persuasive mechanism)
The platform can announce some positions which are rarely matched to the public, seeking more attention from the tech talent
The digital platform can not only introduce the existing job positions inside the federal government, but also help tech talent to know the workflow and working environment of the federal government. (multi-dimensional introduction)


# IDENTIFYING THE PRODUCT GAP

The first stage in the process should be to identify and clearly define the product gap that exists in the project. 

There are technical positions available within the government that are either new or have evolved over time, and need to be marketed to the right audience.
These positions are available across multiple domains within the government, including administrative, legal, human resources, etc - with the common theme being that they are technical in nature.
These positions for the most part are high ranking and leadership positions, either replacing their predecessors or complementing them.
These positions have clearly been defined along with the relevant job descriptions by Tech Talent organization. 
Operating under the assumption that there is technical talent available in the market, which might be interested in the roles or can be convinced into taking up these roles. 
There is a need to connect the right talent to these positions.

## JOB CATEGORIES AND DESCRIPTIONS

The positions are across multiple domains within the government human resources:

These positions are in the following broad categories:
Administrative
Legal
Program Manager
Privacy Specialist
Information Officer
Technology Officer
These are high ranking positions within the government structure, and therefore required skilled individuals but also professionals who have served in high-ranking positions.
Since the government does not have a legacy for these positions in the public sector, considerable talent needs to be recruited from the private sector.
There are certain core competencies that are required for the positions - enlisted in the brief prepared by Tech Talent.

# BRIDGING THE GAP

There are existing tools within the market that connect skilled professionals with appropriate positions, across the public and the private sector. 
Some prominent existing platforms are LinkedIn, Glassdoor, etc.
These platforms can serve as good options for headhunting, but are not very effective in matching the requisite skills with the appropriate positions.
There is a need for a New Web Platform, where professionals can be matched with the positions according to the skillset, have the opportunity to review the demands of the position, reach out to the key employers, and actively apply for even those positions they donâ€™t really match with completely. 
The core competencies already identified by Tech Talent can serve as the broad categories, and can further be granulated into smaller sub-categories with domain expert consultation.
The application would also need to be connected to existing platforms like LinkedIn, and allow for information to be exported to the platform where appropriate.
